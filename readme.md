# Basic app

This is example/template of python app template
Main concept of this app:
1. Layers (idea from Hexagonal/Clean Architecture but not so strict) and borders
2. Interface independence (HTTP, RPC over Rabbit, GRPC)

This template and concepts are great for micro- and regular services, data processing services and CLI tools. But also can be applied to a big web application.
