# Very opinionated python app template

### Why this template is created?

I launch project's from time to time and copy-paste patterns from one project to another and it take time to collect things that I need.
So I thought that it is a good idea to collect as much patterns as possible in one place

### Concepts of this template
1. Layers of application
2. Dependency injection
3. Maximum possible independence from outer code (libs, frameworks & etc)
